<h1 align="center">Thank You!</h1>


<p/align="center"><font color="Red"><big> I would like to thank you for checking out my very first website! I realize that this is a somewhat rough looking website as it is my first time doing anything like this, so for it being my first time I think it came out pretty solid. Being an exercise science major I am not really that used to having to do any work like this, most of the work we do is in a lab and involves a very hands on approach. Although this is a very different topic than anything else that I have learned about, I am glad I learned it so in the future I can work on my own site for my business.</big>
