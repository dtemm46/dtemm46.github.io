<p/style="padding-top:5em; color:White; font-size:20px;" align="center">Welcome to my website! This website includes an introduction of myself and a little about me as well as my favorite hobbies, professional goals, and lastly a page thanking you for checking out my site! To start my name is Dylan Temm and I am a senior exercise science major at the University of Maine. I hope to graduate this August after my internship is done and then find a job in the area until I can save up enough money to move south and start building clientele down there. If you are interested in learning more about me, check out the next few pages on my site!
