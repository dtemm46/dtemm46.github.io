<h1 align="center">Professional Goals</h1>

<p/align="center"><big>I have many goals I would like to achieve in my professional career. As an exercise science major I obviously want to be in a gym setting everyday. I would like to get certified to be a strength and conditioning coach and then work for either a specialized gym or an athletic team.  After a few years with on the job experience I would ideally like to move south and open up my own gym to coach people out of! I would like to work with not only athletes but the general population as well. While I believe it would be very cool to work with anyone from a budding athlete to college or professional stars, there is nothing more rewarding in my eyes than watching a normal person improve their lives and gain confidence right in front of your eyes. </big></p>
